DONT DELETE THIS FOLDER IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE EMPTY.
Folder is necessary for the /download feuture to work to download from AWS to local machine and send through telegram from there because unlike the upload and other feutures, download doesn't have a Stream option to pass through file data.
Folder empties itself automaticly.
MAKE SURE THIS FOLDER, AWS S3 FOLDER BEING USED AS CONTAINER FOR STORAGE, AND "AWSandLocalContainFolder" VARIABLE VALUE IN config.json ARE ALL THE SAME.
